# Pokemon Battle Simulator
<br /> Two users create a trainer each based off name input, and then once prompted, select three Pokemon each from different classes before battling. 
## How the Code Works:
<br /> The main method runs first to take inputs from the users, then calls the fight method, which starts with player one making the first move.
<br /> The first phase of the fight runs through, however the rest is a work in progress.
<br /> The fight concludes with one of the players being victorious, which will be displayed.
